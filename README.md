### About me ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Chris and *~~graphic design~~ organization management is my passion*.
At least that's what I've been doing for the past ~9 years, so I can't really deny it any longer ðŸ˜„
You can usually find me working on a variety of free software projects, often as part of the architecture team or as
a community manager.

Currently, I'm mostly focused on projects that are related to network security, RTS game development, and deep learning. However,
I'm also easy to get interested in other stuff as long as I think its cool and exciting :)

## Projects ðŸš€

Here's a list of interesting/fun/useful projects I have worked on:

* [REST-Attacker](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/REST-Attacker): Extensible REST API pentesting tool written in Python that automates much of the usual testing process.
* [openage](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage): Modern RTS game engine that allows AoE-style gameplay.
* [corona-warn-app](https://github.com/corona-warn-app): Official German COVID contact-tracing app (now discontinued).

## Contact ðŸ“«

Anything about the projects I'm working on is probably best discussed in the repos themselves, but if you really want to contact me personally, you can email me at **colonel.panic@mailbox.org**. Please don't be rude or spam me with unimportant stuff, thanks!
